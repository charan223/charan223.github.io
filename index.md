## About Me

Masters(research) student in Machine Learning at [Mila, Montreal](https://mila.quebec/en/)


# Bio

I am a second year master's student at Mila Lab/ University of Montreal supervised by [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/) and [Alain Tapp](https://sites.google.com/view/alain-tapp-mila/home) since September 2019.
Currently working on awesome research projects in Modular Continual Learning, Multi Domain Meta-Learning, Fairness/Differential Privacy in Deep Learning and Optimization in Meta-Learning. 
I am also collaborating with [Microsoft Research, Montreal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/) and [Huawei Research, London](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) during my masters.

Before joining masters, worked with Cisco Systems, Bangalore for one year working on an awesome cloud computing and distributed systems project. Also did an amazing internship at [ETS, Montreal](https://www.google.com/search?q=ets+montreal) with [Herv√© Lombaert](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/hlombaert/)
Prior to that I completed my bachelor's in Computer Sciences from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.google.com/search?q=iit+kharagpur) working with [Avisek Lahiri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avisek-lahiri-9b240748/) on cool computer vision projects.
